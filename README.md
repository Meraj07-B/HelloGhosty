# Endless Runner - Ghost Edition

This project is a recreation of the [Endless Runner Series](https://github.com/BlackthornProd/EndlessRunnerSeries) originally created by [BlackthornProd](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUcB2qrNypBz5soL3eQAFJQ), with my own unique additions and improvements. The main character is now a ghost, and I've enhanced the UI and animations to provide a better gaming experience.



## About the Game
This is an endless runner game where you control a ghost character, dodging obstacles that come your way. The game uses keyboard input (arrow keys) to control the ghost's movement and avoid hitting obstacles. With improved animations and a polished UI, the game offers a smooth and visually appealing experience.
